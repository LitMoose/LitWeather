 LitWeather

==============

LitWeather.py is a small-talk generator based on degrees and locale. 
This is the first thing I'm posting on GitHub and is largely a test for giggles. 

Tested with Python 3.2.7 in Windows 10 and 3.6.6 in Kali Linux

To Run in Windows: 

Ensure Python is installed for windows. 
Save the LitWeather.py file
Windows key + r, type cmd, hit enter
OR 
Go to the folder with LitWeather.py and open command prompt

If you run cmd from start, cd into the folder with LitWeather.py
type LitWeather.py and hit enter. 

Enjoy :) 

To Run in Linux: 

Download LitWeather.py
Open terminal in folder containing LitWeather.Py
Type (your version of Python) LitWeather.Py and select enter
Example: Python3 LitWeather.py 

Enjoy :)
