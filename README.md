 LitWeather

==============

LitWeather.py is a small-talk generator based on degrees and locale. 

I don't come here often, and figured it'd be a good way to break the ice. 

Tested with Python 3.2.7 in Windows 10 and 3.6.6 in Kali Linux

To Run in Windows: 

Ensure Python is installed for Windows. 

Save the LitWeather.py file.

Windows key + r, type cmd, hit enter

type LitWeather.py and hit enter. 

Enjoy :)
